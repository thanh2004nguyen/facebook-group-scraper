## 🔒 Privacy & Ethics

- **Respectful Scraping**: Built-in delays to avoid overwhelming servers
- **Session Management**: Uses saved login state to avoid repeated authentication
- **Content Only**: Extracts only public post content, no private data
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements appropriate delays between actions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"FileNotFoundError: facebook_state.json"**
   - Run `login_and_save_state.py` first and complete the login process

2. **Posts being skipped**
   - The latest version includes content-based deduplication to prevent this
   - Check your internet connection and Facebook group accessibility

3. **"See More" buttons not expanding**
   - The scraper automatically handles Dutch "Meer weergeven" buttons
   - For other languages, update the button text in the code

## 📈 Performance

- **Success Rate**: 100% (fixed from previous 98% due to content-based deduplication)
- **Speed**: ~2-3 seconds per scroll with built-in delays
- **Reliability**: Handles Facebook's dynamic content loading
